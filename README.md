# Hey

This is a simple comparison between languages. Mostly synthetic bernchmarks, these are not one-to-one real life comparisons on the fastest, but do shows pretty well the slowest ones.

For now it's mainly prime, fibonacci and fizzbuzz, wich are really simples e all three of them shows a plato on the fastest langs, these simply aren't enough to truly show their differences.
For that reason I do plan on makin also some string operations and json parser, maybe also something that allocates and modifies memory, to get some step closer from something that would really impact a real project.

This repo is mainly for pratice with git and github.

I plan on doing this slowly, as I'm still on my babysteps to learn C# e programming in general. Therefore, if I  find this is taking too much time from my usual learning I will leave it to the side.

If you wanna add a language or enhance one I did, feel free do it. I do think it would be interesting to have a web server to test how much requests each handle together with the general performance, but that would take too long and I probably wouldn't be able to make every as performant as it could. Both because I lack experience at the moment as much as is quite hard to master how languages do things in their own way.
